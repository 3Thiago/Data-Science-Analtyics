    "3. The higher loan amounts will be less desirable to lenders thus will dampen the chances of loans being approved.  (**Loan Amount**)\n",
    "4. A higher number of dependents will dampen the approval rates due to higher demand on household income. (**Dependents**)\n",
    "5. Persons with higher incomes are more inclined to be given a loan due to their ability to repay thus less risk involved. (**Income**)\n",
    "6. Higher Education levels should correlate to higher incomes than lower levels thus increasing chances of getting loan approved. (**Education**):\n",
    "7. Self-Employed persons are less likely to be approved for loans due to unstable, inconsistent income vs that of an employed person. (**Employment Terms**) \n",
    "8. The longer loan terms will lead to a greater likelihood of loan approval as this means that the borrower's ability to repay is greater over the life of the loan.  (**Loan Amount Term**)\n",
    "9. A higher Co-Applicant income will increase chances of loans being approved as these persons are used as collateral. (**Co-applicantIncome**)\n",
    "10. Persons in urban areas will have higher approval rates than other areas as urban areas have higher home prices than rural house prices. (**Property Area**)"
