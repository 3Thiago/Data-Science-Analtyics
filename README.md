My Official Practical Experience in Data Science
All my analyses will be done in Jupyter notebook along with notes as comments as to my thought process on how I arrived to the conclusion I got to.

Below is the order in which I performed the analysis:
1. Iris Dataset Prediction
2. Titanic Dataset Survival Prediction
3. Big Mart Sales Prediction
4. Loan Approval Predicition
5. Boston Housing Prices Prediction
